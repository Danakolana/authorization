# Authorization
An Object-Oriented Authorization Framework for nodejs. 
Unlike others, it allows end-users rather than developers to define authorizations profiles and objects. 

In real use cases, control which pages can be viewed or not is far more enough. 
We usually require different users have different permissions on different objects. 
For example, user A can edit blogs with tag  "DB", while user B can add blogs with tag 'JS'.

## Example
```javascript

    var Authorization = require('node-authorization').Authorization;
    var compileProfile = require('node-authorization').profileCompiler;
    var fs = require('fs');
    
    // Read the authorization profile from file system and compile it. 
    // You can also store profiles in DB(recommended).
    var rawProfile = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./example/testProfile01', 'utf8'));
    var compiledProfile = compileProfile(rawProfile);
    
    var Authorization = new Authorization('UserID', compiledProfile);
    if(!Authorization.check('blog', {Tag:'DB',ID:1000001, Action:'Add'})){
       //Report a message, and break;
    }else{
       //Do the add blog;
    }
```

The authorization profiles consist of authorization objects and their authorization fields and values. 
They are in JSON format and can be maintained through all possible UI tools. 
They are recommended to be saved in DB so that they can be easily associated with login user IDs. 
You can develop a role maintenance UI, which generates the authorization profiles. 
When the roles are assigned to users, the corresponding authorization profiles are also assigned.

An authorization profile example:

```javascript
[
    {   "AuthObject": "user",
        "AuthFieldValue":{
            "Group": ["Ordinary"],
            "Action": ["Create","Edit","Display","Delete","Lock","Unlock"]
        }
    },
    {
        "AuthObject": "blog",
        "AuthFieldValue":{
            "Tag": ["DB", "JS", "Algorithm"],
            "ID": [{"Operator":"Between", "Option":"Include", "Low":1000000, "High":1999999}, 2399999],
            "Action": ["Post", "Edit", "Publish"]
        }
    }
]
```

You can find more details in the *example* folder, and run the tests by typing following bash:
 ```bash
    $ npm run test
 ```
 
## To Begin

1. Install it:

    ```bash
    $ npm install node-authorization --save
    ```
    
2. Require it and use:
    
   ```javascript
   
       var Authorization = require('node-authorization').Authorization;
       var compileProfile = require('node-authorization').profileCompiler;
       
       var Authorization = new Authorization('UserID', compiledProfile);
       if(!Authorization.check('blog', {Tag:'DB',ID:1000001, Action:'Add'})){
           //Report a message, and break;
        }else{
           //Do the add blog;
        }   
   ```
    
## With ExpressJS and PassportJS

It is easy to confuse authentication with authorization. 
While authentication verifies the userâ€™s identity, 
authorization verifies that the user in question has the correct permissions and rights to access the requested resource.
The two always work together. Authentication occurs first, then authorization. 

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) is a popular authentication middleware which is compatible with [Express](http://expressjs.com/).
And now you can use Node-authorization together with Passport and Express. You only need to do following 4 steps:

1. In your Passport login strategy, when the user identification is verified, roll-in its authorization profiles:

```javascript
    passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
      function(username, password, done) {
        User.findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) {
          if (err) { return done(err); }
          if (!user) { return done(null, false); }
          if (!user.verifyPassword(password)) { return done(null, false); }
          
          //Begin profiles roll-in
          //Get user raw profiles, compile them, and save the compiled profile to the user(session) object
          ...
          user.authProfile = compileProfile(rawProfiles);
          //End profiles roll-in
          
          return done(null, user);
        });
      }
    ));
```

2. In the passport "serializeUser" function, save the compiled profile to the session storage:

```javascript
    passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
        //You are recommended to save the compiled authorization profile into session storage.
        //By doing this, it gains performance when you do authorization checks.
        //The "user" object is supposed like this: {id:'001'; authProfile:[...]}.
        done(null, user);
    }),
```

3. In the passport "deserializeUser" function, initialize the Authorization object with the session profile:

```javascript
    passport.deserializeUser(function(user, done) {
        if(user.id && user.authProfile)
            user.Authorization = new Authorization(user.id, user.authProfile);

        done(null,  user);
    });
```

4. In your restful APIs, embed the authorization checks:

```javascript
    addBlog:function(req,res){
        if(!req.user.Authorization.check('blog', {Tag:'DB', ID:req.body.blog.ID, Action:'Add'})){
            res.end('You do not have the permission to add a new blog!');
        }else
            blog.addBlog(req.body.blog, function(msg,blogId){
                ...
                res.json(msg);
            })
        }    
    },
```

When a user is logged on, the authorization profiles are compiled and saved in the login session storage. 
Then each time the user performs an action on an object, 
corresponding authorization checks can be done before it actually happens. 
Developers can decide where to embed the "authorization.check()" statements.
